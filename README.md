# sorting-mini-project
As the name suggests, it's our mini-project for the sorting lab.

Name: Amelia Vrieze
Purpose: Various implementations of sorting methods, including an "original" sorting method.
Acknowledgements: Sorting implementations were begun in labs during class, but none of that code ended up directly copied into this project. "VriezeAmeliaSort" relies on InsertionSort and MergeSort (not invented by me). I relied on many of the class readings to help with implementation.
